# cv-devcontainer-proj
Computer Vision project including the docker container files used to build the dev environment.

This is the ExHomography branch.

Building the DevContainer image takes a considerable amount of time, due to OpenCV being built from source during image building. Find the built Docker image on https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ayomeer/cv-devcontainer-image/general.
